>>>variables always have a specific type and that type cannot changeThe keyword .
>>>"var" is used for declaring variables of a particular data type.
*there are three types in datatypes

int8  8-bit signed integer
int16   16-bit signed integer
int32   32-bit signed integer
int64   64-bit signed integer
uint8   8-bit unsigned integer
uint16  16-bit unsigned integer
uint32  32-bit unsigned integer
uint64  64-bit unsigned integer
int Both int and uint contain same size, either 32 or 64 bit.
uint    Both int and uint contain same size, either 32 or 64 bit.
rune    It is a synonym of int32 and also represent Unicode code points.
byte    It is a synonym of uint8.
uintptr It is an unsigned integer type. Its width is not defined, but its can hold all the bits of a pointer value*/
